Now we'll go back to CI creation in the normal fashion. We'll take the `ames` data from the CIs lab earlier today and regard it now as a **sample**, we won't be drawing any smaller samples from within it. This is the usual situation in an analysis: you use all the data available to you!

<br>

**Task 1.**  
Load the data again, `clean_names()`, and re-familiarise yourself with it

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)

ames <- read_csv("data/ames.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

ames
```

<br>

**Task 2.**  
Investigate the distribution of `lot_area`. Is the distribution roughly normal? If not, what problems do you find?

```{r}
lot_parameters <- ames %>% 
  summarise(lot_mean = mean(lot_area),
            lot_sd = sd(lot_area))

ames %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = lot_area) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "turquoise", binwidth = 2000) +
  
```

<br>

**Task 3.**  
Compute and visualise a bootstrap sampling distribution for the `mean(lot_area)` of the sold houses.

<br>

**Task 4.**  
Use your bootstrap distribution to calculate a $95\%$ CI for `mean(lot_area)`, and visualise it on the distribution

<br>

**Task 5.**  
You would like to know the `mean(lot_area)` of the sold houses with higher confidence. Calculate the $99\%$ CI for this variable (you can re-use your bootstrap distribution from above). Is it narrower or broader than the $95\%$ CI? Does that make sense?

<br>

**Task 6.**  
Calculate the point estimate of the `mean(lot_area)`

<hr>

# Extension

<br>

**Task 1.**  
Calculate a point estimate and $95\%$ CI for the proportion of houses in the data built before 1920.  Does the number of `reps` you use matter? [Investigate `reps` from $200$ up to $50000$, memory of your laptop permitting].
