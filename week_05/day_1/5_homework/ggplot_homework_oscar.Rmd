# Homework Info

## Learning Objectives<br>

* Practice making plots with ggplot2
* Create your own theme and use it with plots

## Background

QikBit is a start-up company producing low cost fitness trackers. Their flagship product, the KwikBit Unit1 (spot the mistake on the patent form) reproduces the functionality of the best-in-class commercial fitness trackers, but is cheap to make.  They are currently preparing to pitch to a potential investor and require a selection of charts to include in their presentation and promotional materials.

## Data

The data for this assignment is provided in the `CodeClanData` package.

* `qb_revenue_breakdown`
* `qb_monthly_sales`
* `qb_competitors`
* `qb_device_data`

Take a little time before you start to familiarise yourself with the data.

FOR EXTENSION THEME:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("palette.JPG")

theme_t <- function(base_size = 12){
  list(
    theme(title = element_text(size = 20),
          axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
          plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', colour = NA),
          panel.grid = element_line(colour = "grey50")),
    scale_color_manual(values = col_scheme),
    scale_fill_manual(values = col_scheme)
  )
}

# MVP

## Part 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(CodeClanData)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
```


**Question 1.**  
Take the data in the dataset `qb_revenue_breakdown` and make a stacked bar chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset.
<br>

```{r}
ggplot(qb_revenue_breakdown) +
  aes(x = Year, y = Revenue, fill = Product) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Sources of Revenue by Year") +
  theme_t()
```

**Questino 2.**  
Make a line chart showing monthly sales of the "flagship product" - the 'KwikBit Unit 1' - over the last year. This data is inside `qb_monthly_sales`, but you will need to use `filter()` or `subset()` (base `R)`.
<br>

```{r}
ggplot(qb_monthly_sales %>% filter(Cashflow == "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales")) +
  aes(Date, Amount) +
  geom_line(colour = "red") +
  theme_t()
```

**Question 3.**  
Make a line chart showing monthly revenue and costs over the last year. This data is also in `qb_monthly_sales`.						
<br>

```{r}
ggplot(qb_monthly_sales %>% filter(Cashflow != "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales")) +
  geom_line(aes(Date, Amount, colour = Cashflow)) +
  theme_t()
```

**Question 4.**  
Show annual sales of personal fitness trackers over the last 5 years broken down by company as a ribbon plot (use `geom_area`). This data is in `qb_competitors`.
<br>

```{r}
ggplot(qb_competitors) +
  aes(Year, Revenue, fill = Company) +
  geom_area() +
  theme_t()
  #scale_fill_manual(values = col_scheme)
```

**Question 5.**  
Now show the sales from the four competitors as a line graph. Include an extra layer that shows the data points used to make the lines.
<br>

```{r}
ggplot(qb_competitors) +
  aes(Year, Revenue, colour = Company) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Revenue vs. Year for QKBit's competitors") +
  theme_t()
```

**Question 6.**  
Now the company wants to compare the number of steps that their device counts vs. their competitors. Make a line graph of the number of steps throughout time, and use faceting to compare between companies and people. The data for this is in `qb_device_data`.
<br>

```{r}
ggplot(qb_device_data %>% group_by(device, id, hours) %>% summarise(avg_count = mean(counts))) +
  aes(hours, avg_count) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(device~id) +
  labs(title = "QKBit steps counted vs. Competitors",
       x = "time (hrs)",
       y = "steps") +
  theme_t()
```

## Part 2 

**Question 1.**  
Take the plots that you produced in part one and now polish them by:

1. Adding appropriate labels
2. Changing the scales and coordinates when appropriate.
3. Applying a unified theme, which is described below:
  * Graphs should have white backgrounds, and use colour sparingly.
  * There should be faint grid lines.
  * Font sizes should be ~12pt although titles should be slightly larger and axis labels can be slightly smaller. 
  * All plots should use colours from the following company colour scheme.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("palette.JPG")

theme_t <- function(base_size = 12){
  list(
    theme(title = element_text(size = 20),
          axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
          plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'white', colour = NA),
          panel.grid = element_line(colour = "grey50")),
    scale_color_manual(values = col_scheme),
    scale_fill_manual(values = col_scheme)
  )
}

## RAN OUT OF TIME
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
col_scheme <- c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040")
```
<br>

# Extension

**Question 1.**  
Try out different ways of plotting these three datasets. Which graphs do you think are particularly effective at showing QikBit's success?
